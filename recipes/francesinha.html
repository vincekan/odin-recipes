    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Portuguese dish. <br>Good thing there's healthcare in the EU. <br>The result of putting everything unhealthy that you can imagine into a sandwich. And then deep frying it. And then putting a slab of cheese on top.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of soft bread</li>
        <li>1 thin beef steak, tenderized</li>
        <li>1 pork sausage</li>
        <li>1 cured pork sausage, lingui√ßa</li>
        <li>2 slices of ham</li>
        <li>5 slices of cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a frying pan over high heat. Meanwhile, cut the sausages in half then butterfly-cut them.</li>
        <li>Fry the sausages in their own fat, then use the remaining fat to fry the steak. Finally, lightly fry the ham slices.</li>
        <li>Gently toast the bread slices. Start putting the Francesinha together: On a plate, place one bread slice, then a slice of cheese, ham, steak, the sausages, and the final bread slice.</li>
        <li>Fry the egg, place it on top of the sandwich, cover it with the cheese slices, leaving the egg-yolk visible.</li>
        <li>Bring the sauce to a boil, then spoon it on top of the sandwich. The hot sauce will melt the cheese. Serve it either with a side of French fries, or surrounded by fries if your plate is big enough!</li>
    </ol>
