    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>UK dish. <br>Guaranteed visit to the NHS. <br>Basically a chicken escalope with melted cheese on top.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 x chicken fillets (approx 200g each)</li>
        <li>Plain flour (for dredging)</li>
        <li>1 egg + a splash of milk (for dredging)</li>
        <li>Panko or any natural breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Sunflower/rapeseed oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>200g Mature Red Leicester or coloured Cheddar (grated)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove any excess fat and butterfly the chicken.</li>
        <li>Place on a chopping board under a sheet of cling film/parchment and bash out each fillet with a tenderising mallet (or rolling pin), to an even thickness.</li>
        <li>Dredge the meat; first into the flour, then egg, then the breadcrumbs. Ensure that the coating is even all over then set aside.</li>
        <li>Add sunflower/rapeseed oil to a large frying pan to a depth of roughly 1cm and heat. Once the oil reaches its optimal temperature, cook the fillets (one at a time) for approximately 2 minutes on each side, till the breadcrumbs have turned golden.</li>
        <li>Place the fillets into a preheated oven at 180C for 8-10 minutes to finish them off. Check the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the middle (75C minimum internal temp.).</li>
        <li>Cover the fillets with a generous layer of bechamel sauce, sprinkle on the grated cheese and place back in the oven or under a grill till it is melted.</li>
    </ol>
